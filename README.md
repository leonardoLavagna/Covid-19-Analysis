# Covid-19 Deaths Data Analysis

<img width="886" alt="covdeaths" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91341004/159719268-7ddad453-52cd-4547-ae9c-d84d870dfae3.png">


We are going to study some available data (see https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths and the files branch of this repository to download the tables we used) about Covid-19 deaths and cases. The main idea of this project is to build an SQL database with the available data and carry out some (hopefully) interesting queries.

### There are some visualizations available!

- https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/leonardo.lavagna/viz/CoronavirusCOVID-19Cases_16489085239110/COVID-19GlobalView

to see the `Tableau Dashboards` associated to this project. Some of the tables used to make such visualizations are available in the files branch of this repository.

### There is an interesting article related to this topic
The group R2D3 has done a remarkable job in explaining Covid-19 simulations, and I feel like the following article is relevant and worth to read to make bettere sense out of the work carried out in this repository: http://www.r2d3.us/covid-19/.
