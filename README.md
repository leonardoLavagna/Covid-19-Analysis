# Covid-19 Deaths Data Analysis

<img width="886" alt="covdeaths" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91341004/159719268-7ddad453-52cd-4547-ae9c-d84d870dfae3.png">


We are going to study some available data (see https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths) about Covid-19 deaths. The main idea of this project is to build an SQL database with the available data and carry out some (hopefully) interesting queries. The results will then be interpreted and compared with other independant enquiries.

### There is a visualization available!
Go to https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/leonardo.lavagna/viz/CovidProjectDashboardv1_1/Dashboard1?publish=yes to see the `Tableau Dashboard` associated to this project. The tables used to make such visualizations are available in the files branch of this repository.
