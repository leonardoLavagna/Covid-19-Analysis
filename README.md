We are going to study some available data (see https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths and the files branch of this repository to download the tables we used) about Covid-19 deaths and cases. The main idea of this project is to build an SQL database with the available data and carry out some (hopefully) interesting queries.

### There are some visualizations available!
